# Security Policy 🕵️‍♂️🔐

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find a security issue, please do **not**:
- Announce it on Twitter with a spicy meme.
- Add it to your LinkedIn profile as "Hacker".
- Print it out and mail it via carrier pigeon.

Instead, please:
- Open a *issue*.
- Use words, not smoke signals.
- Bonus points if you bring cookies. 🍪

## Supported Versions

- `latest commit` – _**probably**_ secure.
- `anything older than that` – LOL good luck.
